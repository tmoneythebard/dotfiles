*** [2020-01-09] Efficiency and que time.
- I asked a question regarding my last call: over 1 hour. Wiley asked if there was usage on account, I wasn't sure. IE if usage why was a second SIM activating: problem with device or maybe network not the SIM card.
- Brief conversation about lollygagging during calls, dragging calls out and why that happens. If agents think that available time exists, then they end calls quicker, overall more productive.
- Discussed notes on calls and formatting.
  - Wiley did not use format, preferred one line  to enter information.
