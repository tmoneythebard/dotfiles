**** DONE Belmont Dentistry
     - Note taken on [2020-08-31 Mon 14:19] \\
       - Dentist visit went well. My lower left molar is missing. I am not sure it was ever there.  Was seen by Dr. Sandhu's wife (also Dr. Sandhu) for the first time. She recommomended another implant since my upper left molar is coming down out of the bone/gum since there is not another tooth working to keep it in place. 
       - Took CT scan to see if there was enough bone to do the implant in the first place.
